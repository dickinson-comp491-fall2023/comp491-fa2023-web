# Attendance

As stated on the syllabus, the course centers around the capstone
project and discussion sessions. These activities are meaningful only
if students are present to interact with other students and the
instructor. Therefore, attendance is required at all classes and is a
graded component of the course.

Attendance is worth 5% of the final grade, computed as follows:

| number of unexcused absences | attendance score        |
|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| 0-2                          | 5                       |
| 3                            | 4                       |
| 4                            | 3                       |
| 5                            | 2                       |
| 6                            | 1                       |
| 7                            | 0                       |

Please do not come to class if you are sick. The instructor will
always grant you an excused absence if you have a genuine illness. If
you are unwell, notify the instructor in a timely fashion, giving as
much advance notice as possible before the class.
