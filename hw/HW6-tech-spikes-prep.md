# COMP491 Assignment HW5: Tech Spikes Preparation

This assignment is worth 30 points and is expected to take about three
hours for each individual student, although some parts can be
completed in teams. As usual, log activity using your Slack live log.

Students pursuing a research or honors project *do* complete this
assignment. Please consult with the instructor to determine
appropriate content for the tech spike in your research project.

## Introduction

In agile software development a *spike* is a small side-project done
to test an approach or to learn something new.  The goal is to learn
enough about the approach or the new topic to inform the work on the
main project.

## Assignment

In this assignment, you will prepare for a spike to learn more about
some key technologies used in your project.  Specifically, you will:
- analyze your team's present knowledge and skills as related to your
  project's technical requirements;
- identify resources that will help team members begin to fill in
  missing knowledge and skills.

In the future P1 assignment, you acquire the missing knowledge and
skills identified here, then demonstrate the new knowledge and skills
in a presentation.

Additional details are given below.


* <font color="red">Concrete steps that you must take are formatted as
  red bullet points, like this one.</font>

### Getting Started

* <font color="red">Create new wiki page named "Tech Spikes", linked
  from your team's wiki page.</font>


### Gap Analysis

A *gap analysis* is a process that can be used by a business, a team,
or an individual to compare their current state to a desired future,
and then to set goals to move toward that future. You will use a gap
analysis to understand the knowledge skills that your team currently
has and the knowledge and skills that you may need to be an effective
member of your project's community. Gap analyses are often performed
in a four-step process, as described in this [gap analysis
template](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/gap-analysis-template/)
provided by Forbes magazine.

* <font color="red">Perform a gap analysis for your team, and record
   the results under a new header named "Gap Analysis".</font>
   - You can use the formal four-step process described on the link
     above, or a more informal approach. Whichever approach you use,
     the final result must be a plan describing which knowledge or
     skills each member of your team plans to acquire. 
   - These learning tasks could be assigned to individuals or
     subteams. For concreteness, we refer to each individual or
     subteam identified here as a *tech spike subteam*. Each tech
     spike subteam has a *gap*: specific knowledge or experience
     which they must acquire.
   - Not every team member must develop knowledge and skills in every
     area. It is acceptable to develop specializations within your
     team.
   - Carefully study the separate page [Basic milestones for the capstone project](milestones.html). This lists five basic
     milestones that should be achieved before beginning contributions
     to your H/FOSS project. It may be helpful for one or more of your
     tech spike subteams to focus on one of these milestones. For
     example, you could identify a gap which is "learn how to
     run the test suite for this project."
* <font color="red">In summary, the Gap Analysis section of your wiki
  page should list each tech spike subteam together with the gap
  identified for that subteam.</font>

### Learning Resources and Activites

In this part of the activity you identify *learning resources and
activites* to fill in the gaps identified above.

* <font color="red">Add a new header named "Learning Resources and
  Activities" to your team's Tech Spikes page.</font>
* <font color="red">Each tech spike subteam adds their own subsection
  to the Learning Resources and Activities section. Populate the
  subsection with an annotated list of resources (with links) that
  will provide the knowledge and experience to fill the gap.</font>

Some tips for building this list:
   - Use resources that are identified by the project.
   - Ask your project community. Using the appropriate communication
     channel, explain what you are trying to learn and how you think
     it will help your team engage with he project and ask for
     suggestions of good resources.
   - Do a web search to identify resources (tutorials, lessons,
     videos, articles, etc.) that will help you begin to fill the
     gap.
   - Examine a large number of resources superficially, then narrow
     them down to a small number (1-5) that seem the most appropriate.
   - Remember that the P1 assignment, due later in the semester,
     requires you to demonstrate something you have built or achieved
     during the tech spike. Therefore, choose at least one learning
     resource that will help you build a demo that is interesting and
     fun.

## Submission

All outputs of this assignment are recorded on your team wiki pages as described above.

## Rubric

A good grade can be achieved by: following all instructions
accurately; producing material that reflects about three hours of
effort per student for this assignment (with evidence of time spent on
the Slack live log); employing correct grammar, effective design, and
clear presentation of concepts on the relevant wiki pages. For an
excellent grade, some evidence of additional research, insight, or
thoughtfulness may be required.
