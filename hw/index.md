# Assignments for COMP491


## Overview of the capstone project

The most significant component of COMP491 is the *capstone
project*, which is started in COMP491 during the fall and completed in
COMP492 during the spring. As is usual for COMP491/492, some students
work in teams on contributions to a large-scale pre-existing
*open-source project*; others work individually on a *research
project*.

The goals for the project are as follows.
* For open-source projects, the goal is to make meaningful
  contributions to the upstream project, which can include:
  documentation improvements, bug gardening, bug fixes, commenting on
  issues, resolutions of issues, and any other contributions. It is
  highly desirable to have contributions accepted by the upstream
  project maintainers, but it is also possible for a capstone
  open-source project to succeed in many other ways.
* For research projects, the goal is to produce empirical and/or
  theoretical results that address the research question.

In all cases, grading of assignments related to the capstone project
will take into account demonstrated effort as well as concrete
achievements. This principle applies to 5-15 reports, presentations,
and other assignments related to the capstone project. The best way to
demonstrate effort is to maintain a detailed and regular *Slack
live-log*, as described next.

## Slack live-logs

A Slack live-log is a Slack channel that will be used to assess effort
invested in the capstone project. You may also use the same
channel for communication among your team members, but its primary
purpose is as a detailed diary to show the instructor when you have
been working on which tasks. It is recommended that you log some kind
of message every 30 minutes while working. Typically, you would
describe in 1-2 sentences what you achieved in the last 30 minutes and
what you are planning to do in the next 30 minutes.
