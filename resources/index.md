# Detailed schedule

## Class 4, Friday 9/8/2023

* I will present a couple of contrasting open source projects:
  [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) vs [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)
* Any questions about Slack livelog?
* Most of the class time will be spent on a lab day for individual
  work on HW2 (Project exploration).
* Get help with the GitHub section of HW1 if you need it.
* Yes, I am accepting music suggestions for the lab session. Post on Slack.
* I will be inviting volunteers to tell us a little bit about their
  favorite project, including show us the website and/or repositories
  and point out a few interesting features. Depending on how many
  eager volunteers there are, we will pause of the lab session at
  around 3:30 PM or 3:45 PM to hear from anyone who would like to do
  this. Think of it as your chance to advertise your project and
  recruit people to your team.
