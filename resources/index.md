# Detailed schedule


## Class 2, Friday 9/1/2023

* We will go over the instructions for our first formal discussion
  class on Monday, including how to approach assignment NQP1.
* If you haven't done so already, do the first part of HW1, so that
  you are signed up to our COMP491 Slack workspace.
* Most of the class time will be spent on a lab day for individual
  work on HW2 (Project exploration).

  forum](https://lms.dickinson.edu/mod/forum/view.php?id=1215029) on
  Moodle. Give the name, brief description and the URL for the most
  promising project you have looked at so far -- the one you would be
  most excited to work on.
* In the last 15 minutes of class, we will discuss some of the
  promising projects posted on Moodle.
