Below are a few preliminary ideas of how to analyze this. Nothing is
fixed yet. Feel free to discuss with me. **If you would like to
express a preference for changing the preliminary plan below, please
discuss it with me by 5pm on Wednesday, September 27.** Preferably,
this discussion would take place in person, but you can also do it by
email or phone. Note that I may consider allowing one or more students
to work in a solo team (i.e. on their own), if they can make a
legitimate case in favor of that.


There's an obvious cluster of students selecting Sugarlabs as their first choice. That defines
* **Team 1**: Belgin, Ethan, Mel, Myra, Sai, Sophia.

Souha chose Sugarlabs as 2nd choice and could also go into Team 1.

There's another cluster of four students selecting HuggingFace as
first choice. This defines
* **Team 2**: Christian, Evan, Tanner, Aaron

Marcel and Michael also included HuggingFace in their choices, but
ranked them pretty low. They could be added to Team 2, perhaps.

If we eliminate the students definitely assigned to Team 1 and Team 2, we are left with the following:


|   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Andrew|Mermaid|ImagesToPDF|TimetoLeave|Jupyter|PyTorch |
|Dung| GNUOctave| ApacheKafka| SpringBoot| OpenMRS| PyTorch|
|Giang| OpenBSD | LLVM | Tor | Metasploit|
|Marcel| SpringBoot| ApacheKafka| HuggingFace| TensorFlow| PyTorch|
|Michael| Mermaid| FreeCodeCamp| OpenMRS| HuggingFace| PrivacyGuides|
|Souha| AnkiDroid| Sugarlabs| Mermaid| FreeCodeCamp| TimetoLeave|
|Tap| ApacheKafka| PyTorch| Metasploit| NextCloud| OpenBSD|


This leads me to tentatively group into a team the students selecting
Apache Kafka as first or second choice:
* **Team 3**: Dung, Marcel, Tap

We also have two students selecting Mermaid as their first choice, which could result in
* **Team 4**: Andrew, Michael

Souha rated Mermaid third and could also join Team 4 (or Team 1 as mentioned earlier).

That leaves Giang to be either added to a new (solo) team or joined
onto one of the existing teams.

With the teams as described above, almost everyone who specified
preferred teammates has got one or more of their choices on their
team, but I acknowledge that this constraint was not satisfied for
everyone.

There is another thing that I'm curious about. I'm not sure whether to
take this into account or not. The teams above were determined purely
on project choices, guided by the reasoning I have
explained. Nevertheless, the teams given above are largely segregated
along lines of gender, race, and national or regional origin. Ideally,
our teams would consist of more diverse groups. However, perhaps it is
more important to form groups of people who are eager to work on
similar types of projects. I'm open to receiving views and advice on
this issue. Thanks!
