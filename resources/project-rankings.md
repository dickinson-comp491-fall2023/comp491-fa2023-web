# Project rankings

Here are the rankings submitted in HW4. Please advise me of any errors or omissions.

|   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Aaron|HuggingFace | FreeCodeCamp | Sugarlabs | HomeBrew | OWASPNettacker|
|Andrew| | | | | |
|Belgin| Sugarlabs| Mermaid| FreeCodeCamp| WikimediaCommonsApp| AnkiDroid|
|Christian| HuggingFace| Mermaid| PyTorch| NextCloud| ApacheKafka|
|Dung| GNUOctave| ApacheKafka| SpringBoot| OpenMRS| PyTorch|
|Ethan| Sugarlabs | Metasploit | HomeBrew | PrivacyGuides | SpringBoot |
|Evan| HuggingFace| Metasploit| Sugarlabs| OpenEnergyDashboard| SpringBoot|
|Giang| OpenBSD | LLVM | Tor | Metasploit|
|Marcel| SpringBoot| ApacheKafka| HuggingFace| TensorFlow| PyTorch|
|Melantha| Sugarlabs| OBSStudio| OpenMRS| DokuWiki| FreeCodeCamp|
|Michael| Mermaid| FreeCodeCamp| OpenMRS| HuggingFace| PrivacyGuides|
|Myra| Sugarlabs| Mermaid| FreeCodeCamp| TimetoLeave| AnkiDroid|
|Sai| Sugarlabs| TimetoLeave| PrivacyGuides| NextCloud| Mermaid|
|Sophia| Sugarlabs| FreeCodeCamp| OpenMRS| Mermaid| PyTorch|
|Souha| AnkiDroid| Sugarlabs| Mermaid| FreeCodeCamp| TimetoLeave|
|Tanner| HuggingFace| OBSStudio| ImagestoPDF| DokuWiki| WikimediaCommonsApp|
|Tap| ApacheKafka| PyTorch| Metasploit| NextCloud| OpenBSD|


Here are a few preliminary ideas of how to analyze this. Nothing is
fixed yet. Feel free to discuss with me.

There's an obvious cluster of students selecting Sugarlabs as their first choice. That defines
* **Team 1**: Belgin, Ethan, Mel, Myra, Sai, Sophia.

Souha chose Sugarlabs as 2nd choice and could also go into Team 1.

There's another cluster of four students selecting HuggingFace as
first choice. This defines
* **Team 2**: Christian, Evan, Tanner, Aaron

Marcel and Michael also included HuggingFace in their choices, but
ranked them pretty low. They could be added to Team 2, perhaps.

If we eliminate the students definitely assigned to Team 1 and Team 2, we are left with the following:


|   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Andrew| | | | | |
|Dung| GNUOctave| ApacheKafka| SpringBoot| OpenMRS| PyTorch|
|Giang| OpenBSD | LLVM | Tor | Metasploit|
|Marcel| SpringBoot| ApacheKafka| HuggingFace| TensorFlow| PyTorch|
|Michael| Mermaid| FreeCodeCamp| OpenMRS| HuggingFace| PrivacyGuides|
|Souha| AnkiDroid| Sugarlabs| Mermaid| FreeCodeCamp| TimetoLeave|
|Tap| ApacheKafka| PyTorch| Metasploit| NextCloud| OpenBSD|


This leads me to tentatively group into a team the students selecting
Apache Kafka as first or second choice:
* **Team 3**: Dung, Marcel, Tap

That leaves Andrew, Giang, Michael, and Souha to be either added to a
new team (maybe working on Mermaid?) or joined onto one of the
existing teams, whichever they prefer.

I may also consider allowing one or more students to work in a solo
team (i.e. on their own), if they can make a legitimate case in favor
of that. Anyone interested in doing so, please discuss it with me by
5pm on Wednesday, September 26.

There is another thing that I'm curious about. I'm not sure whether to
take this into account or not. The teams above were determined purely
on project choices, guided by the reasoning I have
explained. Nevertheless, the teams given above are largely segregated
along lines of gender, race, and national or regional origin. Ideally,
our teams would consist of more diverse groups. However, perhaps it is
more important to form groups of people who are eager to work on
similar types of projects. I'm open to receiving views and advice on
this issue. Thanks!
